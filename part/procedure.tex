Overview of the bridge’s procedure
\setenumerate[2]{label=\arabic*.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Producing basic paper beams 
\item Producing bridge’s main long beams
\item Producing paper stripes
\item Assembling one side of the bridge
\item Connecting two sides of the bridge to form the structure
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Producing basic paper beams
\item Producing bridge’s main long beams
\begin{enumerate}
\item Measure 3 cm from the right side of a beam.
\item Place the forepart of the scissors into the hollow area of the beam. Cut off the right side of the beam by 3cm along only one of its diagonals.

\item Apply glue on the inner surface of the cut beam from the right side of the beam by 3 cm.
\item Plug the left side of another beam into the right side of the former beam straightly. 
Caution: be careful with the direction of two beams, and they should be a straight line. 
\item Repeat step1 to step 4 on the second, the third, the fourth and the fifth beams. 
\item Use electric hair drier to dry the connection part of the long beam, which is composed by 5 basic paper beams. 
\item Use pencil to mart the middle of the long beam. Measure 25cm, 50 cm, and 53 cm from the middle point to both sides of the beam. Mark these four points on the beam respectively. 
\item Repeat step1 to 7 to produce another long beam.
